Cameroon you cradle of our Fathers

O Cameroon, you cradle of our Fathers. 
Holy Shrine where in our midst they now repose.
Their tears and blood and sweat your soil did water,
On your hills and valleys once their tillage rose.
Dear Fatherland, your worth no tongue can tell!
How can we ever pay your due?
Your welfare we will win in toil and love and peace,
Will be to your name ever true!

Land of Promise, land of Glory!
you, of life and joy, our only store!
Yours be honour, yours devotion,
And deep endearment, for evermore.

From Shari, from where the Mungo meanders
From along the banks of lowly Boumba Stream.
Muster your sons in union close around you.
Mighty as the Buea Mountain be their team;
Instill in them the love of gentle ways,
Regret for errors of the past;
Foster, for Mother Africa, a loyalty
That true shall remain to the last.

Land of Promise, land of Glory!
you, of life and joy, our only store!
Yours be honour, yours devotion,
And deep endearment, for evermore.
